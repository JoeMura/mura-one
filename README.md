AI-Powered Remote Housing Platform
Project Overview
This project is a modern web application designed to streamline the real estate search process in Kenya. It allows users to find and view potential houses from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need for expensive and time-consuming travel to physical locations.
As a Cyber Security student at the Co-operative University of Kenya, I developed this platform to explore the intersection of rapid AI-assisted development and secure cloud architecture.
The Problem & Solution
The Problem: Traditional house hunting is inefficient, often requiring physical visits to multiple sites before finding a suitable match.
The Solution: A centralized digital platform that provides high-quality property insights remotely, saving users time and resources.
Tech Stack
Frontend & Prototyping: Lovable AI (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS).
Backend & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for real-time data storage and management.
Authentication: Supabase Auth for secure user login and session handling.
Development Environment: Built and tested primarily on Linux systems.
Key Features
Remote Property Discovery: Users can browse verified listings without physical site visits.
Secure User Accounts: Robust authentication powered by Supabase to protect user data.
Dynamic Data Handling: Real-time updates for house availability using PostgreSQL.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop users to ensure accessibility.
Security Implementation (Academic Focus)
Given my background in Cyber Security, I have prioritized the following security measures:
Row Level Security (RLS): Implementing Supabase RLS policies to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to see.
Input Validation: Protecting the platform against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
Network Analysis: Using tools like Wireshark during the testing phase to monitor data packets and ensure secure transmission between the client and the Supabase backend.
Current Project Status: 🛠️ Under Refinement
This project is currently in a "Fix and Optimization" phase. I am actively working on:
Refining the backend database queries for faster property filtering.
Enhancing the UI/UX generated by Lovable AI for better user flow.
Finalizing the hosting environment for public deployment.
